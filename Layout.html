		<p>Run trough the cold of the night, as passions burn in your heart. Ready to fight, a night is close by your side. Like a lone wolf alone in the dark, with eyes that watch the world, and my name like a shadow on the face of the moon. Broken mirror, a million shades of light, the old echo fades away, but just you and I, can't find the answer and then.</p>
	</div>
	<p>In the blue of night. And angel wings. The song of the seasons are her only crown.</p>
